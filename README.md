## Tic-Tac-Toe Rules

- Requires
2 people

- Game Play
One player (designated X) makes the first move by drawing that letter in any one of the 9 boxes; O follows by making the second move. The game can have only three outcomes: either player may emerge victorious by linking three of their letters horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, or else the game ends in a ‚Äúcat‚Äôs game‚Äù in which neither player connects three in a row.

- Objective
However you arrive there, no matter the strategy ‚Äî three in a row wins the game
